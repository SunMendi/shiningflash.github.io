## **PUBLICATIONS**

### **A Deep Learning Approach to Integrate Human-Level Understanding in a Chatbot**  
Presented at **10th International Conference on Natural Language Processing (NLP 2021)** | *Sydney, Australia Â· October 10, 2021*  
- **Abstract**: This research presents a deep learning approach to enhancing chatbot interactions by integrating human-level understanding. The study focuses on four major components: Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, Intent Classification, and Named-Entity Recognition (NER). The integration of these techniques improves the chatbot's ability to respond with more contextually appropriate and interactive conversations, moving closer to human-like interaction.  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Developed a comprehensive model integrating multiple NLP tasks.
  - Demonstrated improvements in **sentiment detection** and **intent classification**, enhancing chatbot interaction by **30%**.
  - Set the foundation for future advancements in human-like chatbots.
