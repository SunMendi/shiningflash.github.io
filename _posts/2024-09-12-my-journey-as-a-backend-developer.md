ðŸŽ¯ **My Journey as a Backend Developer** ðŸ’¡

Sometimes, the best opportunities come when youâ€™re not even looking for them. When I started as an intern at **Leads Corporation**, I was supposed to join the Android development team. But I noticed a bigger challengeâ€”the chance to work on the **VerifID (eKYC)** backend project. It was a huge responsibility, but I approached my manager and asked him to trust me with it. Taking on this challenge didnâ€™t just transform the digital onboarding process for over **12 banks** in Bangladeshâ€”it transformed my entire career. It marked the beginning of a journey where taking on big responsibilities became a central theme.

At **Evaly**, one of the top e-commerce platforms in Bangladesh, I worked on two critical areas. I implemented advanced backend logic that reduced transaction discrepancies by **25%**, directly improving **customer trust** and **satisfaction** across all digital platforms. I also developed a **high-performance eHealth Order service** supporting over **1 million users**, optimizing data retrieval and reducing system load times by **40%** during peak sales events. These improvements played a crucial role in handling massive traffic during special sales periods like Evaly's discount events.

At **Supertal**, I had the privilege of leading a brilliant team of developers. We built a **custom algorithm for a trip management system** as part of a **smart warehouse management solution**. This significantly improved logistics, reduced manual effort, and increased order fulfillment efficiency by **20%**. Additionally, as a **solution expert** in the e-commerce team, I optimized performance and increased **customer satisfaction by 30%**. My work on complex systems and high-impact projects helped me rise to a senior position ahead of the standard timelines.

Most recently, at **WellDev**, I focused on optimizing a **Python library for file and log management**, which improved system performance by **30%** and reached nearly **100% test coverage**. I also developed a **custom authorization middleware** with multi-tenancy support, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the system. Through this, I was able to improve the serviceâ€™s efficiency while mentoring and training my colleagues.

Looking back, my love for coding started at university, where I participated in programming competitions and solved problems on online judges. These experiences laid the foundation for my problem-solving abilities and prepared me for the challenges I faced in my professional career.

### **What Iâ€™ve Learned**

If thereâ€™s one thing that stands out in my journey, itâ€™s this: never be afraid to take on big responsibilities, even if they seem bigger than what you're ready for. By pushing beyond your comfort zone, the final reward will be beyond your imagination.

Here are three key areas that have helped me grow as a developer:

1. **Become a Problem-Solver**: The ability to tackle complex challenges is at the core of what we do.
2. **Learn to Communicate**: Whether itâ€™s explaining technical solutions or collaborating with a team, communication is key.
3. **Build Lots of Projects**: The more you build, the more you learn. Experience is the best teacher.

If you focus on these areas consistently, thereâ€™s no limit to how far you can go as a developer. ðŸš€
